"""
For reading a CSV file as a dataframe, you can use the built-in function
pd.read_csv('path_to_file_name') where path_to_file_name is the name of the CSV file
"""

"""
To loop through a DataFrame, we can use the structure:
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    loop_body
where index is the row index, and row is the key: value pairs for that specific row
"""

"""
In a single row, to access the value associated with a column key, you can use the syntax row[key]
For example, if you are given a row with a column called "Name", you could access the value with row["Name]
